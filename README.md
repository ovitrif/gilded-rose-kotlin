My shot at the GildedRose refactoring Kata, created by [@TerryHughes](https://twitter.com/) and ported to
Kotlin by [@emilybache](https://twitter.com/emilybache).
Original requirements:
[GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) repository.

## Build
- Open project with [IntelliJ IDEA Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Navigate using the Project viewer to `src > test > kotlin`
- Right click on **"ðŸ—‚ kotlin"** and pick **"â–¶ Run all tests"**

## Limitations
Since it is specified as a project requirement to keep the Item class unchanged,
it could be considered that the `ItemUpdaters` class violates the OCP principle.

Lifting this specification would allow to move the updating logic in the typed items
which would implement an `Updatable` interface, and thanks to polymorphism this
would further simplify the program and add to its readability and maintainability.
